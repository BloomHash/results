# Results
Below is a link to tables with the results from VADER sentiment analysis. The first sheet has columns for each candidate for the positive, negative, neutral tweets; the difference between the positive and the negative tweets, the percentage of positive tweets out of the total tweets for that candidate, and the percentage of negative tweets out of the total tweets for that candidate. The next sheet has the positive tweets, negative tweets, neutral tweets, positive - negative difference, positive percentage, negative percentage, and	neutral percentage for each candidate for the entire trimmed down dataset. The last sheet has the same columns as the previous but is based on the dataset before it was trimmed down to the tweets that had location values.
